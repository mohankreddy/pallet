*CreatePipe(new Input2CharSequence("UTF-8"),new CharSequence2TokenSequence(tokenPattern), 
	    true,new TokenSequenceRemoveStopwords(true, true), 
	    new TokenSequence2FeatureSequence(),new Target2Label(), 
	    new FeatureSequence2FeatureVector(false), 
	    true);*

This function will create the Pipelist by adding the instances of all the pipes.

*Note*
The first and second argument are must for this method. We can provide null for 4,5,6 and 7 arguments. This depends on the user ,that which pipes he/she wants to use in the application


The following pipes are used by the application. We will look into the each of the pipe one by one and explains what each one do.

The purpose of the each pipe is explained below.

1)Input2CharSequence::Convert Input data to character sequence
  
2)CharSequence2TokenSequence::Convert character sequence to token sequence
  
3)TokenSequenceLowercase::Convert all tokens to lower case.
   
4)TokenSequenceRemoveStopwords::Remove stop words . 

5)Target2Label::Convert object in the target field into label in the target  field.
 
6)FeatureSequence2FeatureVector::Convert the data field from feature sequence a 
  to a FeatureSequence
    
7)PrintInputAndTarget::Print the data and target field of each instance.
