#Our task list from which we coordinate with one another and generate release notes.

= Reduce Complexity =
Any task listed here should take 1 hour to no more than 2 weeks work.  If a task listed will take more than 2 weeks work then it should be broken into sub-tasks that take less time.

= Tasks =
(%) - means the task needs to be broken down into several sub-tasks
