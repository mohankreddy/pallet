#Classifying RDF Resources.

= Introduction =

Usually classification occurs on un-structured or semi-structured text.  RDF/XML is of course very structured.  However in general we should focus on the RDF, and not as much on the XML.

= RDF Breakdown =
RDF triples are statements in the form:
  * Resource (otherwise known as a Subject)
  * Property (otherwise known as a Predicate)
  * Object

So logically we can say any statement:
Lance (Resource/Subject)
isLabled (Property/Predicate)
"Lance Byrd" (Object)

Lance
is married to
Annie

Lance
is located at
latitude 34.618302 and longitude -79.012475

In these three cases, the first and third objects, "english" and lat/long, are literal objects.  These are the kinds of objects we want to focus on initially.  The second object "Annie" probably wouldn't be a literal object in RDF.  Instead Annie would be another Resource, just as Lance is a Resource.  Using the example RDF that we will be testing against, the RDF for these two would look like the following:

        <bb:incidentDescription>An unidentified perpetrator called the Lumberton, North Carolina emergency communications center on 4 March 1999 and claimed that anthrax bacteria had been released in the Lumberton Dialysis Clinic. The city manager, Todd Powell, received the call. 40 people at the clinic were detained for three hours, most of whom were patients. Officials investigated the scene and instructed patients on self-decontamination procedures. According to FBI Spokeswoman Joanne Morley, a similar message was found written on a sheet of paper in the clinic's mailbox. Powell said at the time of the incident that officials had no evidence or indication that the claim was genuine.[A]</bb:incidentDescription>

        <dc:source>[A] Graham Brink, "FBI officials investigate anthrax false alarm in Spring Hill," St. Petersburg Times (26 March 1999).</dc:source>
        <bb:incidentDescription>On the morning of 26 March 1999, a jogger near Portillo Road and Sandlor Street in Spring Hill, Florida found a plastic milk jug with the word "anthrax" written on it in pen. Officials closed off the area and discovered three more half-gallon containers within approximately a 200-foot radius. All three bottles appeared to be capped and empty and included references to Jim Morrison and the Doors in similar handwriting. After a cursory inspection, the bottles were placed in hazardous material bags. FBI agents arrived on the scene at 12:40 p.m., and after investigating the scene and making a preliminary assessment of the situation, deposited the bags containing the jugs in their vehicle.</bb:incidentDescription>
