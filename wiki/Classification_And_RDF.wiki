#Classifying RDF Resources.

= Introduction =

Usually classification occurs on un-structured or semi-structured text.  RDF/XML is of course very structured.  However in general we should focus on the RDF, and not as much on the XML.

= RDF Breakdown =
RDF triples are statements in the form:
  * Resource (otherwise known as a Subject)
  * Property (otherwise known as a Predicate)
  * Object

So logically we can say any statement:
Lance (Resource/Subject)
knows (Property/Predicate)
english (Object)
